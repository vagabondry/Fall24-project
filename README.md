# Fall24-project
This project develops a Self-Improving Chatbot designed to engage in meaningful conversations with users via Telegram. The bot uses Deep Learning models for language understanding and response generation, and leverages Reinforcement Learning for improvement based on user feedback. Over time, the chatbot hopefully refines its responses, aiming to enhance conversational quality and user satisfaction.
