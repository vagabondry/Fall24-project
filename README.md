# Fall24-project
This project aims to depelop a Self-Improving Chatbot designed to engage in somewhat meaningful and hopefully fanny conversations with users in groupchats expectedly in Telegram. The bot will use deep learning models for language understanding and response generation, and leverage reinforcement learning for improvement based on user feedback. Over time, the chatbot feasibly will refine its responses.

Instructions will be added after achieving more practical results.
